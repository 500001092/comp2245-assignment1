<h2>Absael Young Romero</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Absael and here are some things about me. I am born in Antigua, but my parents are from the Dominican Republic, so I have relatives in both countries. A random fact about me is I am not yet 6ft tall. I am somewhat of a car enthusiast and I love to spend time with either family or gaming. Right now my favourite car is the BMW 440i (which is an inline-6 cylinder B58 platform, making around 300HP), but unfortunately I don't have the funds for it at the moment. I currently drive my dads old, reliable but issue producing, 2005 Nissan Almera SG, which has around 120,000 miles and a dream. That's about it :).</p>
